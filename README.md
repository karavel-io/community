# Karavel Community

Community resources and discussions around the Karavel Project

## Communication channels

Engaging with the Karavel community can be done on multiple communication platforms. The development team and other community members can be reached out via the following channels.

## Mailing Lists

- [Main users list](https://groups.google.com/g/karavel-users) (Direct email: [karavel-users@googlegroups.com](mailto:karavel-users@googlegroups.com))
- [Development list](https://groups.google.com/g/karavel-dev) (Direct email: [karavel-dev@googlegroups.com](mailto:karavel-dev@googlegroups.com))

Non-Google email address can join the mailing lists by sending a message to the sub address `+subscribe`, e.g. [karavel-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:karavel-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com). Similarly, sending an email to `+unsubscribe` will remove the list membership.
